# Ransomware 
The goal of this project is to create a program that communicates with a live Node.js server configured with A+ SSL and a RESTful API to recursively encrypt a a User's folder using cryptographically strong algorithms. Implementations of each program can be further explored by looking through the appropriate folders.
